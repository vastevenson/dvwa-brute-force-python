### DVWA Brute Force Python Example

This repo shows how to use Selenium and Python to perform a brute force attack on the `/brute/` route of the DVWA (PHP web app). 

It is assumed that the DVWA is running locally at http://localhost:4280/ - and that you already have installed Selenium Chrome Driver and configured it correctly. I installed it through `brew install --cask chromedriver`
